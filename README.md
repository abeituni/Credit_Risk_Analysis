# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
For this challenge, we used 6 different Machine Learning algorithms to predict credit risk based on consumer data. With these algorithms, we assessed which model would work best for predicting risk.


## Results
-Naive Random Oversampling:
  - Balanced Accuracy: 64.9%
  - Precision: 99%
  - Recall: 68%

-SMOTE Oversampling:
  - Balanced Accuracy: 64.4%
  - Precision: 99%
  - Recall: 66%

-Undersampling:
  - Balanced Accuracy: 64.4%
  - Precision: 99%
  - Recall: 45%

-Combo Sampling:
  - Balanced Accuracy: 52.9%
  - Precision: 99%
  - Recall: 45%

-Balanced Random Forest Classifier:
  - Balanced Accuracy: 81.6%
  - Precision: 99%
  - Recall: 91%

-Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier:
  - Balanced Accuracy: 68.9%
  - Precision: 100%
  - Recall: 100%

## Summary
Based off our results, Balanced Random Forest Classifier & Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier had the highest percentage of balanced accuracy. Precision was high with all 6 algorithms; all being 99 or 100%. Balanced Random Forest Classifier had the highest recall percentage with 91%. Based off the results of the data, it seems like the Balanced Random Forest Classifier would be the best Machine Learning algorithm to use for an analysis like this one.
